# useProxy

The name `useProxy` was inspired by React [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

Just like `useState`, it is mainly designed to work with React applications. 

Unlike `useState`, which only works with React functions; `useProxy` mainly works with React classes.

`useProxy` is the successor of [SubX](https://github.com/tylerlong/subx), which is similar to MobX.


## Installation

```
yarn add use-proxy
```
